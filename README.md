# 🧵CommonThread🧵

CommonThread is an open-source collaborative tool that enables users to turn stories into insights. Community-based organizations, journalists, researchers, and community members alike can use the tool to efficiently gather stories, aggregate them, and understand common threads to draw insights for action.

## Set Up :hammer:

To set up a local development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install UV**: If you haven't already, install UV
2. **Sync the Environment**: After installing UV, you need to sync the environment. This will set up the necessary configurations and dependencies for your project. Run the following command:
```bash
uv sync
```
3. **To add a new package**: If you need to add a new package, you can do so by running:
```bash
uv add <package_name>
``` 

## Settin Up Your .env and SECRET_KEY :key:
1. **See the .env.example file**: The `.env.example` file contains a template for the environment variables you need to set up. 
2. **Copy this file and rename it to `.env`**: This will be your actual environment file where you will set your variables. You can do this by running:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
3. **Set the SECRET_KEY**: Open the `.env` file and set the `SECRET_KEY` variable. This key is sent to you privately.
