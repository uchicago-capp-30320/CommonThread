# 🧵CommonThread🧵

CommonThread is an open-source collaborative tool that enables users to turn stories into insights. Community-based organizations, journalists, researchers, and community members alike can use the tool to efficiently gather stories, aggregate them, and understand common threads to draw insights for action.

## Set Up :hammer:

To set up a local development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install UV**: If you haven't already, install UV
2. **Sync the Environment**: After installing UV, you need to sync the environment. This will set up the necessary configurations and dependencies for your project. Run the following command:
```bash
uv sync
```
